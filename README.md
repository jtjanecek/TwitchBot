# TwitchBot
A twitch bot made in python. 

# Setup
config.txt contains all the default setup information. You can run it without changing the defaults and go to twitch.tv/examplebot1 to see the defaults of the bot.
After running main.py (with python 3.4 or higher) a gui will appear to let the user change the defaults at runtime.
After the bot joins the stream, another GUI will appear that will show logging information and an exit button.

# Plugins
Plugin functionality for those users who know python. See ExamplePlugin and TriviaPlugin for examples.

# Creating Plugins
Follow the skeleton of ExamplePlugin.
Make a folder, .py module, and class with the same name (example ExamplePlugin).
Have the needed methods in your plugin class.
That't it.
