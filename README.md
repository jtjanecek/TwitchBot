# TwitchBot
A twitch bot made in python. 

# Setup
config.txt contains all the default setup information. You can run it without changing the defaults and go to twitch.tv/examplebot1 to see the defaults of the bot.
After running main.py (with python 3.4 or higher) a gui will appear to let the user change the defaults at runtime.
After the bot joins the stream, another GUI will appear that will show logging information and an exit button.
